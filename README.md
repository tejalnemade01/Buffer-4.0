This is an Inventory System for an online store which comes under DIGITAL SOCIETY .
This is a Java program that allows users to add products to the inventory, search for products, delete products, add products to a cart, view the cart, purchase the items in the cart, and remove items from the cart.

The program uses a binary search tree to store the products in the inventory, and a hash map to store the items in the cart. The Product class defines the properties of a product, such as its ID, name, and price, and the TreeNode class is used to represent the nodes in the binary search tree.
